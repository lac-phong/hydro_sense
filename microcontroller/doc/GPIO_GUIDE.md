The `RPi.GPIO` library is the standard library for Raspberry Pi GPIO access in Python.

Note: `RPi.GPIO` is a Raspberry Pi exclusive library. So we will implement a cross-development environment where we **develop on computer, transfer to pi, test on pi, and run on pi**.

Here's a basic guide on how to use its syntax:

### 1. Importing the Library

You'll first need to import the library:

```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
```

### 2. Setting the Pin Numbering Mode

There are two ways you can refer to the GPIO pins:

- **BCM Mode**: Uses the GPIO numbers.
- **BOARD Mode**: Uses the physical pin numbers.

You can set the mode using:

```python
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)  # or GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
```

### 3. Setting Up a Pin

You'll need to configure each GPIO pin as either an input or an output:

```python
GPIO.setup(17, GPIO.OUT)  # Set GPIO 17 as an output pin
GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.IN)   # Set GPIO 18 as an input pin
```

For input pins, you can also activate the built-in pull-up or pull-down resistor:

```python
GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_UP)   # Activate pull-up resistor
GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_DOWN) # Activate pull-down resistor
```

### 4. Writing to a Pin

You can set an output pin to HIGH (3.3V) or LOW (0V):

```python
GPIO.output(17, GPIO.HIGH)  # Set pin 17 to high
GPIO.output(17, GPIO.LOW)   # Set pin 17 to low
```

### 5. Reading from a Pin

You can read the value of an input pin:

```python
value = GPIO.input(18)  # Read value from pin 18
```

### 6. Setting Up Interrupts

You can also set up edge detection and call a function when a specific event happens on a GPIO input:

```python
def callback_function(channel):
    print(f"Interrupt detected on channel {channel}!")

GPIO.add_event_detect(18, GPIO.RISING, callback=callback_function)  # Detect rising edge
```

You can also detect `GPIO.FALLING` or `GPIO.BOTH` edges.

### 7. Cleanup

Always cleanup the GPIO settings before exiting your program to ensure that the GPIO pins are reset:

```python
GPIO.cleanup()
```

### Common Pitfalls:

1. **Permissions**: You often need to run your GPIO code with `sudo` permissions to access the GPIO pins.
2. **Pin Numbers**: Ensure you're using the correct pin numbers, and you're consistent with the numbering mode (BCM vs. BOARD).
3. **Cleanup**: Always use `GPIO.cleanup()` at the end of your program or when you're done using the pins. This ensures pins are reset and won't remain in a HIGH or LOW state.

For more details and advanced features, you can refer to the [official RPi.GPIO documentation](https://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/Home/). But the above guide should cover most basic use-cases for GPIO interaction on the Raspberry Pi.
