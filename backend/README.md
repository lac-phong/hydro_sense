## Our Goal

As the Backend Team for the HydroSense project, our goal is to connect the microcontroller, Firebase, and the web application. The microcontroller will send the moisture sensor data to Firebase in the correct format, so that users can access it by creating or using a spreadsheet and reading the data from Firebase into the spreadsheet through our user-friendly web-application.
